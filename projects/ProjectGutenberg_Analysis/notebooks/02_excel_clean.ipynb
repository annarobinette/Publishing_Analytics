    "### Notebook 02: Excel Data Clean\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "In this notebook, I will transition from Python to Excel for business-focused analysis of the Project Gutenberg dataset. I will document the Excel-based cleaning process for the dataset exported from the Python collection script. I'll focus on data validation, standardization, and preparation for analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "I'll start by showing the location of the files.\n",
    "\n",
    "## File Information\n",
    "   - Input file: `ProjectGutenberg_Analysis/data/processed/gutenberg_processed.csv` \n",
    "   - Working file: `ProjectGutenberg_Analysis/excel/gutenberg_cleaning_v1.xlsx`\n",
    "   - Output file: - Filename: `ProjectGutenberg_Analysis/excel/gutenberg_cleaned_v1.xls`"

    "### Step 1: Data Import and Initial Structure\n",
    "1. Import Process\n",
    "\n",
    "![Import process](../src/Screenshots/LoadCSV_PowerQuery.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Using PowerQuery, I import the data into an Excel spreadsheet.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Import process](../src/Screenshots/LoadCSV_Result.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Initial Column Review\n",
    "   - The current columns have the following data types:\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   - Book_ID: Number\n",
    "   - Title: Text\n",
    "   - Author: Text\n",
    "   - Publication_Date: Date\n",
    "   - Language: Text\n",
    "   - Download_Count: Number\n",
    "   - Subjects: Text\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 2: Data Validation Checks\n",
    "1. Check for Missing Values\n",
    "\n",
    "![Conditional formatting](../src/Screenshots/Blanks_Conditional.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The first example of missing data was the title 'Beowulf' which famously has an unrecorded author (or lost to history). Rather than visually checking the 74,000 records, I will do a count like I would in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Blank counting](../src/Screenshots/Blanks_Count.png) \n",
    "![Blank counting](../src/Screenshots/Blanks_Count_Close.png) \n",
    "\n",
    "Some columns are completely full and three have missing values of authors, subjects and bookshelves at very small amounts. The available formats field is completely blank, which is disappointing for further analysis. The script looking for blanks in the Data Collection notebook suggested there were none.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Identify Duplicate Records\n",
    "\n",
    "![Count of duplicates](../src/Screenshots/Duplicates_Count.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset is remarkably clean with no duplicates (empty Series for Missing Values), which suggests high-quality data collection from the Gutenberg API. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 3: Column-by-Column Cleaning\n",
    "Now, I will clean the columns one-by-one.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. ID Column\n",
    "I am checking for:\n",
    "- Duplicates:\n",
    "```excel\n",
    "# Create duplicate column check\n",
    "Column: ID_Check\n",
    "Formula: =COUNTIF(gutenberg_processed[id], [@id]) > 1\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Title Column\n",
    "In any string of text, there are probably going to be the following issues:\n",
    "- Extra spaces\n",
    "- Inconsistent capitalization\n",
    "- Special characters\n",
    "\n",
    "```excel\n",
    "# Create cleaned title column\n",
    "Column: Clean_Title\n",
    "Formula: =TRIM(PROPER([@title]))\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Authors Column\n",
    "I can see that there are multiple issues for this column. there are\n",
    "- Multiple authors separated by delimiters\n",
    "- Inconsistent formatting\n",
    "- Missing authors\n",
    "\n",
    "```excel\n",
    "# Create author status column\n",
    "Column: Author_Status\n",

    "            \"Single Author\"))\n",
    "```\n",
    "![Author values](../src/Screenshots/Author_Status.png)\n",
    "For the authors column, there are no missing authors and the majority of titles were written by single authors, with a smaller percentage written by multiple authors.\n",
    "\n",
    "```excel\n",
    "# Count number of authors\n",
    "Column: Author_Count\n",
    "Formula: =IF([@authors]=\"\", 0,\n",

    "![Author counts](../src/Screenshots/Author_Counts.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "I am interested in the titles with multiple authors, so this pivot chart shows the titles and the author count.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Author pivot table](../src/Screenshots/Author_Pivot.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Most of the entries with high author counts are anthologies or collections, technical reports with multiple contributors, literary compilations or scademic collaborations. Research shows that notable examples are:\n",
    "- Atlantic Narratives (24 and 23 authors) - Short story collections\n",
    "- Special report on diseases of cattle (14 authors) - Technical collaboration\n",
    "- Various literary collections and compilations\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. Languages Column\n",
    "Check for:\n",
    "- Invalid language codes\n",
    "- Multiple languages\n",
    "\n",
    "First, I created a list of ISO 639-1 codes as a table:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Language codes](../src/Screenshots/Language_Codes.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, I added column to show if the title had multiple or single language versions:\n",

    "Formula: =IF([@languages]=\"\", \"Missing\",\n",

    "            \"Single Language\"))\n",
    "\n",
    "And counted how many books had multiple languages. THe maximum languages was 3:\n",
