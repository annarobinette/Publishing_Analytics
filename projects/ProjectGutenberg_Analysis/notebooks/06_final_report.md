# Project Gutenberg Analysis: Static Output

### Notebook 06: Overview Presentation and Detailed Report

## Overview Presentation

I created a basic presentation for stakeholders from different departments to understand the Project Gutenberg corpus. [Here](../presentations/Project%20Gutenberg%20Analysis.pptx) is the Powerpoint document.

## Report

###  Summary
Project Gutenberg is a digital library of over 70,000 free eBooks, consisting primarily of works for which U.S. copyright has expired. Founded in 1971, it represents one of the oldest and largest collections of freely available digital books. While not a commercial publisher, analysing Project Gutenberg's data provides valuable insights into digital reading patterns for historical works across different languages. This analysis was conducted to demonstrate data analytics capabilities in a publishing context, specifically examining how historical works perform in digital formats across different languages and markets. By analysing download patterns and language distribution in Project Gutenberg's corpus, I can understand global digital engagement with classic literature - information that could be valuable for publishers considering digital republishing strategies, translation priorities, or market expansion opportunities. However, it's important to note that this analysis has specific limitations: the works are all out of copyright in the US, available only in digital format, and represent historical rather than contemporary content. Despite these constraints, the dataset provides a clean, well-structured sample for demonstrating publishing analytics capabilities, especially in visualising and interpreting multi-language market performance data.

This analysis examines digital publishing patterns based on Project Gutenberg's catalog of 74,896 titles across 70 languages. As this dataset consists entirely of works that are out of copyright in the US and available in digital format, it provides specific insights into:
- Digital reading preferences for classic literature
- Language-specific engagement with historical works
- Subject matter performance in digital format
- Market opportunities for digital classics and public domain works

### Data Context and Limitations

#### Dataset Characteristics
- All works are out of copyright in the US

#### Implications for Analysis
- Download metrics reflect current interest in historical works
- Language distribution heavily weighted toward older publications
- Subject categories reflect historical publishing patterns
- Market opportunities primarily relevant for digital classics/republishing
